### Ground Rules

- **Scope**: Support focuses on experimental design, analysis planning, model diagnostics, and result interpretation. I do not write your assignments or projects.
- **Preparation**: Bring a brief problem statement, your data dictionary, and any code you've already tried.
- **Reproducibility**: Share code and data (or a minimal reproducible example) when possible. Use version control where feasible.
- **Time**: Sessions are typically 30â€“45 minutes. Complex topics may require follow-ups.
- **Fair Use**: This service is for university-affiliated work. Publications should acknowledge consulting assistance where appropriate.
- **Boundaries**: I can advise on statistical methods, not on policy or grading decisions.
