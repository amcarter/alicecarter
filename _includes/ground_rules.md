- **Scope**: Support focuses on experimental design, analysis planning, model diagnostics, and result interpretation. If you need help with coding, please [visit our graduate coding mentors](https://forms.gle/xNRkHvJWM7Efjwq39).
- **Preparation**: I need a brief description of your research question, data structure, and any statistical methods you're considering. Please send relevant materials (e.g., your dataset, analysis code, or proposal draft) at least 24 hours in advance, not including weekends. 
- **Reproducibility**: Please make sure your code is able to run up to the point where we will be working.
- **Time**: Initial consultations are an hour. Complex topics may require follow-ups (30m by default).
- **PI involvement**: Generally, your advisor should be aware of the consultation and supportive of your proposed analysis. If your question involves a fundamental design or framing issue, I may ask you to discuss with them before we proceed. Your advisor is also welcome to join in our meetings at any point if that would be helpful.
- **Fair use**: This service is for university-affiliated work. Publications should acknowledge consulting assistance where appropriate. Co-authorship may be appropriate sometimes too.
